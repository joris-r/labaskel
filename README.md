# Arguments for the language choice

Must have:

- strong static typing (for safety)
- automatic memory management (for safety, and speed of development)
- safe design (runtime error must be avoided)
- several compilers available (possibility to do a double chain of executables)
- can do native compiling (for performance and easier distribution)
- not too exotic (community, support, libraries, documentation and books)
- expressive and abstract (at least pattern matching support)
- stable language (if possible with an approved standard)
- good and stable standard library
- good libraries to program languages tools and compilers
- free and open-source compilers and libraries
